AnonymousLlama problem solving.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Write a program that prints out the numbers 1 to 100 (inclusive). If the number is divisible by 3, print Anonymous instead of the number. If it's divisible by 5, print Llama. If it's divisible by both 3 and 5, print AnonymousLlama. You can use any language. Use GitHub's gist to host your code.
